# basic-RL-algorithm-implementation

Implemented four RL algorithms:

- Baseline: Vanilla Online Q learning (without target network and replay buffer)

- Fitted Q Iteration

- DQN

- DQN-like-version of “SARSA” 

Used three different MuJoCo agents i.e. 
- inverted pendulum
- half cheetah
- walker 2D
